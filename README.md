# unPromoTed

unPromoTed is a simple user script for Chrome which replaces promoted images on Imgur with a small text script. 

It only runs on pages on imgur.com domain, and checks to see if the page contains a meta tag with an attribute of "content" which must equal "promoted."  

If this is true, unPromoTed replaces the imgur with a notification that the content was removed by the script.
