# [unPromoTed](https://github.com/brianboyko/unPromoTed)

[unPromoTed](https://github.com/brianboyko/unPromoTed) is a simple user script for Chrome which replaces promoted images on Imgur with a small text script. 

It only runs on pages on imgur.com domain, and checks to see if the page contains a meta tag with an attribute of "content" which must equal "promoted."  

If this is true, unPromoTed replaces the imgur with a notification that the content was removed by the script.  

## About the author

The author of this script is Brian Boyko, and he's currently crowdfunding the money to go to code camp - and he'll pay the money he raises forward after graduation. Find out more at [http://sendthisguytocodecamp.com](http://sendthisguytocodecamp.com).

## Installation

1. Download the zip file with the little cloud icon raining the little downvote that you see over on the right there. It'll download "unPromoTed-master.zip"

2. Unzip that file wherever you feel comfortable, but it should be someplace that won't get deleted or overwritten.  

3. Go to <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a> in your Chrome browser. 

4. Click the checkmark for "developer mode" so that you can install this extension. (later on, I'll get this in the Chrome Web Store, but for right now, this is an experimental extension). 

5. Drag the unPromoTed-master *folder* you unzipped to the extensions page, and approve permissions.
